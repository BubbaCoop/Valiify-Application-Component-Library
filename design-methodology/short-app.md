# Short App surface — page composition methodology (applicant)

**Status:** v1.0 · 2026-09-10 · extracted from Figma `PA5pr1Q8KLfbjTxdAbFm0V` (Updated-Short-App) and reconciled against `@valiify/shortapp-ui`. This file holds current rules only. Decision history, frame↔library deltas, and resolved items live in `short-app-decisions.md`.
**Scope:** how steps on the applicant-facing Short App are *assembled* from library components — consumer, business, and auto-loan flows. Companion to `dashboard.md`. Not a component spec; fields, buttons, cards, controls and the header are library components and are only referenced here. Component classes named here are the library's; their full specifications, states and markup live in the library's `CLAUDE.md`.

## 0. Conventions

**Sources.** 37 Figma frames across the `Consumer`, `Business` and `Auto Loan` pages, plus 40 PNG exports used only for whole-page composition judgments. `Portal V2` is a separate document; `Credit Card` is empty. Every value is expressed in the library's vocabulary — `src/themes/valiify.css` (58 colours, 6 radii, 24 text styles, 2 effects), `src/utilities/index.css`, `src/components/*.css` (28 components) and `CLAUDE.md`. Where a frame and the library disagree, the library value is the rule and the frame is to be updated in Figma.

**Value notation.** Utility first, with token and hex in parentheses on first mention in a section — `va:bg-surface-app-page` (`--color-surface-app-page`: #fafaf9) — then utility alone. Components are named by class: `.va-select-card`, `.va-box-action va-box-action-checkbox`. Spacing has no tokens by design; Tailwind's scale is the token (4px → `1`, 8px → `2`, 16px → `4`, 48px → `12`). Off-scale whole pixels take arbitrary values (`va:w-[343px]`); half-pixels always do (`va:h-[92.5px]`). A value with no token is written raw and marked `[raw]`. This document does not invent tokens.

Type utilities (`va:text-display`, `va:text-input`, …) carry size, line-height, weight and tracking but **not** font-family or text-transform. The three uppercase styles ship as bundled utilities — `va:type-eyebrow`, `va:type-micro-label`, `va:type-button-label` — and are used in place of the bare `text-*`. No monospace appears on this surface.

**Rule format.** `rule` → **Evidence:** node ids / frame names → **Confidence:** high / medium / low. Open items are collected in §13.

## 1. Layout skeleton

One shell, one column, no rails. Everything below the header is a single 560px column; the only variation is whether a footer button row exists and where it sits.

### 1.1 Web shell (all consumer/business frames, 5 loan web)

- **Canvas is warm off-white `va:bg-surface-app-page` (`--color-surface-app-page`: #fafaf9); surfaces are `va:bg-surface-paper` (`--color-surface-paper`: #fffdfb).** The header, choice cards, inputs, review cards and roster cards are all `va:bg-surface-paper` on the `va:bg-surface-app-page` canvas — a two-tone warm palette, no pure white on the applicant surface. The library's own components already paint this way: `.va-header`, `.va-select-card`, `.va-box-action`, `.va-text-field-box` and `.va-owner-container` are all `va:bg-surface-paper`. **Evidence:** 9:544 frame fill, Header fill, Card fill, input fill. **Confidence:** high.
- **Header is the library's `.va-header` — 60 (`va:h-15 va:px-5`), bottom stroke `va:border-b va:border-stroke-divider` (`--color-stroke-divider`: #1a1a1a @11%, a real 1px border absorbed by the pinned height),** logo centered (`.va-header-logo`, 30 tall, absolutely centered — the crimson in the asset is the client's, untokenized), language selector right (`.va-text-selector`: 16px leading `#globe` `.va-text-selector-icon`, `va:text-help-caption va:text-content-tertiary` label — `--text-help-caption`: Inter Regular 12/14 · `--color-content-tertiary`: #6f7276 — and an 18px `.va-text-selector-chevron`). No back control in the header; no progress bar. `.va-header` is `position: sticky; top: 0` + `va:z-40` by library contract. **Evidence:** 9:544 Header; 449:10429 Header. **Confidence:** high.
- **Single 560 column, centered (x = 680 on 1920)** — `va:w-140 va:mx-auto`. Title block, content, and buttons are all exactly 560 wide; nothing spans wider and nothing sits beside the column. No component owns the column; it is page layout. **Evidence:** Title 560 @680, Content 560 @680, button row 560 @680 on every frame. **Confidence:** high.
- **Vertical rhythm is 48 / 40 / 40 / 48.** The page body is `va:py-12` (48 top and bottom) with `va:gap-10` (40) between its three children: title block → content → button row. **Evidence:** Frame 5 `V gap40 pad48/0/48/0` on all frames. **Confidence:** high.
- **Title block is 90 tall:** eyebrow row (16, `va:type-eyebrow` line box) → `va:gap-2` (8) → title (34, `va:text-display` line box) → `va:gap-2` → description (24, `va:text-input` line box). The 90 is emergent from the three type tokens, not pinned. Present on every step, including the loan offer. **Evidence:** Title frame `V gap8` h=90. **Confidence:** high.
- **The button row is in flow, not sticky, on web.** It follows the content by 40 and the page grows (1505, 1662, 1324 tall frames). Layout: `Back` = `.va-btn va-btn-secondary` (99×48, hug) + `va:gap-6` (24) + primary = `.va-btn va-btn-primary va:flex-1` (437×48); when there is no Back, the primary is `va:w-full` (560). `.va-btn` is `va:h-12 va:px-3.5`. **Evidence:** button frame `H gap24` 560×48 at y = content-bottom + 40; 137:7136 / 137:7266 / 137:7541 full-width primaries. **Confidence:** high (composition); scroll behavior §13.
- **Choice steps advance on card tap and carry a button row containing only `BACK`** (`.va-btn va-btn-secondary`, 99×48, left-aligned, same 40 gap). Step 1 of a flow omits the row entirely. **Evidence:** designer decision 2026-09-09. **Confidence:** high.

### 1.2 Mobile shell

- **375 wide; header 60 (`.va-header` — the same component; its `.va-header-mobile` wrapper swaps the selector label to `EN` below 768px); page container `va:p-4` (16 → 343 column, `va:w-[343px]`), `va:gap-4` (16); a separate 76px sticky footer** (`va:h-19 va:py-3.5 va:px-4`; `.va-btn va-btn-secondary` 99 + `va:gap-5` (20) + `.va-btn va-btn-primary va:flex-1`; `va:z-40`, the sticky-chrome tier) — a **planned library component** (§12; interim recipe §11). Title is `va:text-display` 28/34; the block collapses to 96 tall as the description wraps. **The breakpoint is Tailwind's native `md` (768)**, matching the header's `max-width: 767px` media query; the library defines no `--breakpoint-*` token. **Evidence:** 449:10374–10418 children `Header 375x60`, `Page Container`, `Footer 375x76`; Title Container `Mobile=yes`. **Confidence:** high. **Revised BSA mobile frames (720:8067 / 721:8438, designer change 2026-09-17) pad 20 left/right — `va:px-5`, a 335 column; vertical padding stays 20 in those frames.** Whether the 20 replaces 16 surface-wide is a §13 open item — the loan-flow frames cited here were authored at 16/343.
- **This mobile shell applies to every flow.** No consumer or business step has a mobile frame; by decision they use the same 343 column / 16 padding / 76 sticky footer. **Evidence:** designer decision; 675:4131, 676:4501, 676:4982, 688:5717. **Confidence:** high.
- **Multi-up fields stack on mobile.** Any row of two or three standalone fields (First name / Last name; Phone / ZIP / SSN last 4) becomes one field per row at the standard `va:gap-5` (20) field pitch, including inside the roster's inline form. **Exception:** the joined City / State / ZIP row inside the address composite stays three-up; the State dropdown abbreviates to `ST` and the ZIP placeholder to `ZIP`. Everything else keeps its web composition inside the 343 column. **Evidence:** 675:4131, 676:4982 vs the same steps at 1920. **Confidence:** high.
- **The roles matrix keeps its three columns at 343.** Same card, same `PERSON / CONTROLS / SIGNER` eyebrow header, same 47px rows and *Add another owner* footer; the person column simply absorbs the width. It does not collapse to a per-person list. **Evidence:** 676:4501 vs 676:4620. **Confidence:** high.
- **Roster owner rows hug their content at 343.** The contact line (`phone · email`) wraps to two lines, long names wrap, and the row grows; percentage, badge, `EDIT` and trash keep their positions. The inline form, radio cards, Save / Cancel row and footer affordance keep their web composition. **Evidence:** 676:4982 vs 676:4758; 688:5717 owner rows. **Confidence:** high.
- **Review keeps its two-column rows at 343.** Label column stays fixed (`va:w-[142px]`), values wrap onto a second line; group labels, `EDIT`, add-affordance (B) and the product card's `View Details` link keep their web positions. **Evidence:** 688:5717 vs 688:5554. **Confidence:** high.

### 1.3 Loan offer variant

Same shell, but the content is built from a **legacy** remote library with its own tokens. Use these ten frames for the *UX* of offer selection — total → collapsible breakdown → collapsible coverages with switches → radio offer cards → strikethrough discount — and take no color, radius, type, or spacing values from them. The current-library equivalent of every element is in §4–§5: offer cards are `.va-select-card` (the `<label>` + `.va-radio` variant), coverage opt-ins are `.va-switch`, the button row is §1.1's. The library's portal components — `.va-status-tracker`, `.va-action`, `.va-utility-button` (Text type), `.va-tab va-tab-portal` — appear on **no** in-scope frame and are not mapped by analogy here. **Evidence:** 449:10462 Form Container; designer decision. **Confidence:** high.

## 2. Archetypes

Eight step types compose every screen. A step = eyebrow + title + description + one content block + (optionally) a button row.

| # | Archetype | Content block | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Choice** | 2–7 single-select `.va-select-card`s (76 tall) with chevrons, `va:gap-3` (12) | `BACK` only (omitted on step 1); card tap advances |
| 2 | **Checklist** | 6 multi-select `.va-box-action va-box-action-checkbox` rows (48 tall), first is *None of the below*, hairline under it, `va:gap-3` | Back + Continue (enabled once anything is checked) |
| 3 | **Form** | labelled `.va-text-field` / `.va-dropdown-field` / `.va-radio-field`s (73 pitch) `va:gap-5` (20), optional uppercase sub-section label, optional conditional reveal, optional disclaimer checkbox row | Back + Continue |
| 4 | **Roster** | progress bar + bordered card of `.va-owner-container` rows with inline add/edit form + *Add another owner* footer; or column-headed matrix of `.va-radio`s / `.va-checkbox-control`s | Back + Continue, preceded by a left-rule instruction |
| 5 | **Informational confirm** | one explainer card | full-width Confirm |
| 6 | **Review** | gray uppercase group labels, each with a bordered card: eyebrow, name, label/value rows (12/16); three add-affordances by scope (§5) | Back + Confirm |
| 7 | **Agreement** | 3 disclaimer rows separated by hairlines | Back + Confirm |
| 8 | **Offer selection** | total card with collapsible breakdown → collapsible coverages with `.va-switch`es → radio `.va-select-card`s | Back + Continue (disabled until an offer is chosen) |

- **One question per screen for choices; one topic per screen for forms.** No form step carries more than ~7 fields before a sub-section label or a page break; no choice step mixes card choice with free-text. **Evidence:** every consumer/business frame. **Confidence:** high.
- **The business flow is the reference sequence** (1 Membership → 2 Products → 3 Primary Contact → 4 Business Details → 5 BSA → 6 BSA high-risk → 7 Ownership → 8 Account authority → 9 Additional business details → 10 Review). The consumer flow branches, so its step numbers in the frames are placeholders; the eyebrow increments by the step's actual position in the applicant's workflow. **Evidence:** eyebrow text on all frames; designer decision. **Confidence:** high.

---

## 3. Hierarchy rules

- **Three levels in the title block, always the same three.** Eyebrow: `va:type-eyebrow` (`--text-eyebrow`: Inter Semi Bold 11/16, +10%, bundled UPPERCASE) — the `STEP n OF m` run in `va:text-content-tertiary` (`--color-content-tertiary`: #6f7276), the section name in `va:text-primary-text` (`--color-primary-text`: #a6192e); title `va:text-display va:text-content-primary` (`--text-display`: Inter Medium 28/34 · `--color-content-primary`: #1a1a1a); description `va:text-input va:text-content-secondary` (`--text-input`: Inter Regular 16/24 · `--color-content-secondary`: #54565b). Nothing on the surface is larger than 28 except the consumer Review applicant name (22, `va:text-title`). **Evidence:** Title frames on 9:544, 118:5928, 137:7266; 449:10462 Value. **Confidence:** high.
- **The eyebrow carries position; the header carries none.** "STEP 4 OF 7 / IDENTITY" is the only progress indicator — there is no bar, no dots, no stepper. (The library's `.va-status-tracker` is a portal component and is not used here.) **Evidence:** all frames; Header contains no progress element. **Confidence:** high.
- **Description states the *why*, in one sentence.** "Our institution needs these to verify your account." / "Required to comply with federal banking regulations." / "Pick the account to open today. You can add more later." **Evidence:** description texts. **Confidence:** high.
- **Grouping inside content is by label, not by card, until Review.** Forms use an uppercase sub-section label (`ACCOUNT ACTIVITY`, `va:type-eyebrow va:text-content-secondary`) and a hairline (`va:border-b va:border-stroke-divider`); Review is the first place content is wrapped in bordered cards with their own eyebrow (`PRIMARY APPLICANT`, `BUSINESS` — `va:type-eyebrow va:text-content-secondary`). Review group labels are gray `va:text-content-secondary`, never crimson. The review card itself has no component (§11). **Evidence:** 199:12185 "Account Activity"; 137:7266 / 364:8398 "Selectable field" cards; designer decision. **Confidence:** high.
- **Above the fold, always:** header, eyebrow, title, description, and the first content element. **Never above the fold as a requirement:** the button row — on tall steps it is below the fold by design (1505/1662/1324 frames). **Evidence:** 1080 frames vs 199:12185, 258:13116, 364:8398. **Confidence:** high.
- **Section delimiting is hairline + whitespace; surfaces mean "a thing you can act on."** Hairlines (`va:border-stroke-divider`, #1a1a1a @11%) separate form groups, agreement rows and review rows. Bordered surfaces are reserved for tappable cards (`.va-select-card`, `.va-box-action`), inputs (`.va-text-field-box`, `.va-dropdown-field-trigger`), and the roster/review containers; all of them ring at 1px `stroke-divider` — the components natively (inset box-shadow), the composed containers by the sanctioned class `va:ring-1 va:ring-inset va:ring-stroke-divider` (the same inset 1px shadow; never a `va:border`, which adds to the box). Filled tints appear only on the selected state (`va:bg-primary-bg`, `--color-primary-bg`: #a6192e @6%) and on the inline new-owner form (which drops to canvas `va:bg-surface-app-page` to read as a nested surface). **Evidence:** 137:7541 rows; 199:12185 seams; 258:13116 "New Owner" fill. **Confidence:** high.

---

## 4. Density and spacing rhythm

The surface runs on a 4px grid — Tailwind's spacing scale expresses it directly; the few off-scale values (343, 518, 142) take arbitrary widths, and the one half-pixel height is the library's own (`.va-owner-container` `va:h-[92.5px]`).

| Relationship | Value | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Header | `.va-header` = `va:h-15 va:px-5 va:border-b va:border-stroke-divider` (60, pad 16/20, 1px bottom) | 9:544 Header |
| Body padding | `va:py-12` (48 top / bottom) | Frame 5 |
| Title block → content → buttons | `va:gap-10` (40 / 40) | Frame 5 gap |
| Eyebrow → title → description | `va:gap-2` (8 / 8) | Title frame gap |
| Choice cards | `.va-select-card` = `va:p-4 va:gap-3 va:rounded-md`, `.va-select-card-text` `va:gap-1`, title `va:text-label-strong` 14/20 (76 emergent: 16+20+4+20+16); list `va:gap-3` | 9:544 Card |
| Checklist boxes | `.va-box-action va-box-action-checkbox` = `va:h-12 va:px-4 va:py-3 va:rounded-sm` (48); list `va:gap-3`; hairline after *None of the below* is page-composed (`va:border-b va:border-stroke-divider`) | 199:13001 Box |
| Form field | `.va-text-field` = `.va-text-field-title-row` (`va:text-label-strong`, `va:pb-1.25`) + `.va-text-field-box` `va:h-12` — 73 pitch (20 + 5 + 48); stack `va:gap-5` (20) | 118:5928 Plain Text Field |
| Two-up fields | **Spell it mobile-first, because §1.2 stacks these on mobile and the base direction must be written down, not assumed from flex's default.** Column level: base `va:flex va:flex-col va:gap-5` (one field per row), then `va:md:flex-row va:md:gap-6` with `va:md:w-67` each (268 + 24 + 268). Inside the 518 inline form: `va:flex va:gap-4` (251 + 16 + 251). *A desktop-first spelling here silently ships a stacked row: the prebuilt bundle's utility set is closed and only contains what this file uses, so an unwritten `flex-row` resolves to no rule at all while the `md:` gap still applies — which looks deliberate.* | 258:13116 Row; Additional_Details PNG |
| Radio group | `.va-radio-field` = `.va-radio-field-title` `va:pb-1.25` + `.va-radio-field-options` `va:h-10 va:gap-6` + `.va-radio-field-option` `va:gap-2`; `.va-radio` is `va:size-5` (20) | 118:5928 Radio Fields |
| Disclaimer | `.va-checkbox-control` (`va:size-4.5`) + `va:gap-3` + `va:text-label va:text-content-secondary` — no component (§11) | Disclaimer container |
| Instruction callout | `va:text-help-caption va:text-content-secondary` (12/14) behind `va:border-l va:border-stroke-divider`; `va:mb-4` above the button row — no component (§11) | Footer "Layer field" |
| Button row | `.va-btn va-btn-secondary` + `va:gap-6` (24) + `.va-btn va-btn-primary va:flex-1`; `.va-btn` = `va:h-12 va:px-3.5 va:gap-2.5` (48), icons `va:size-4.5` (18) | Frame 1000001366 |
| Review card | `va:p-4.5 va:gap-3 va:rounded-sm va:bg-surface-paper` (pad 18, gap 12); rows `va:text-timestamp` (12/16) with `va:border-b va:border-stroke-divider`; label `va:w-[142px]` — no component (§11) | 137:7266 / 364:8398 Selectable field |
| Roster owner row | `.va-owner-container` = `va:h-[92.5px] va:px-5 va:py-4 va:gap-4`; the "avatar" is `.va-owner` (`va:size-8.5 va:rounded-sm`, 18px glyph) — not `.va-avatar` | 258:13116 Owner Container |
| Roster inline form | `va:p-5 va:gap-4 va:bg-surface-app-page` (pad 20, gap 16); fields `va:w-[518px]` — no component (§11) | New Owner |
| Roles matrix | header `va:h-6`; rows `va:h-[47px] va:py-1 va:px-4` (46 + 1 hairline) with `box-shadow: inset 0 -1px 0 var(--color-stroke-divider)`; columns `va:w-79` / `va:w-30` / `va:w-30` (316/120/120) — no component (§11) | 298:6425 |
| Progress bar | `va:h-1 va:rounded-full`; label row `va:h-9.5` (38) — no component; track colour `[raw]` (§13) | 258:13116 State |
| Loan cards | legacy geometry, not mapped; the current equivalents are `.va-select-card` (76) and `.va-switch` | 449:10462 |
| Mobile | `va:p-4 va:gap-4`, `va:w-[343px]`; footer `va:h-19 va:py-3.5 va:px-4 va:gap-5` (76, pad 14/16, buttons gap 20) — planned component (§12; interim recipe §11) | 449:10407 |

- **The column is the unit; the card is the second unit.** Every content element is 560 wide (`va:w-140`); nothing narrower than 560 sits alone except two-up fields, and nothing has horizontal margins inside the column except card padding. **Confidence:** high.
- **Vertical rhythm is 40 between blocks, 20 between fields, 12 between cards, 8 inside the title block** — `va:gap-10` / `va:gap-5` / `va:gap-3` / `va:gap-2`. Four steps, consistently. **Confidence:** high.
- **Touch targets are 48.** Inputs (`.va-text-field-box`, `.va-dropdown-field-trigger`), buttons (`.va-btn`), checklist boxes (`.va-box-action-checkbox`) and the *Add another owner* affordance row are all 48 (`va:h-12`); choice cards are 76; radios/checkboxes 18–20 (`.va-checkbox-control` `va:size-4.5`, `.va-radio` `va:size-5`) inside 40px rows (`.va-radio-field-options` `va:h-10`). **Confidence:** high.

---

## 5. Component selection rules

- **Card list for a single choice; box list for multiple; radios for yes/no.** Choice cards = `.va-select-card` as a `<button>` with `.va-select-card-chevron` (76, chevron, no commit button) when exactly one option advances the flow. Checklist boxes = `.va-box-action va-box-action-checkbox` (48, `.va-checkbox-control` inside, commit button) when several may apply. Inline `Yes / No` = `.va-radio-field` (`.va-radio-field-option`s composing `.va-radio`; never a `.va-dropdown-field`, never a `.va-switch`) for binary questions inside a form. **Evidence:** §2 archetypes 1–3; 118:5928 Radio Fields. **Confidence:** high.
- **Dropdown for enumerations, text for free entry, formatted placeholder for anything with a shape.** `Select…` = `.va-dropdown-field` (a `<button>` trigger, 48, `aria-haspopup="listbox"`, opening the shipped `.va-dropdown-list` › `.va-list-option va-list-option-sm` panel) for revenue bands, employee counts, industry; `.va-text-field` with `000-000-0000`, `MM/YYYY`, `00000`, `0.00`, `••••` placeholders (native `::placeholder` in `va:text-content-hint` — `--color-content-hint`: #8e9195). Currency inputs carry a leading `$` in the `.va-text-field-icon` slot (18, `va:text-content-secondary`, glyph `#dollar-sign`). **Free entry splits by shape of answer:** a single-line answer is `.va-text-field` (48 box, 73 pitch); an answer that is a *list or a sentence* is `.va-text-area` (79 box, 104 pitch) — see §10. Choose by what the question asks for, not by expected length: "To or from which countries?" takes a multi-line field because the answer is a list, even when one country is a valid answer. **Evidence:** BSA.png, Full_time.png, Short_App.png, 118:5928 AttachMoneyRounded; BSA Filled 199:12185 → 636:2045, 636:2448 (two `Text Area Field` instances, 560×104). **Confidence:** high.
- **Toggle only for "reveal more fields."** The single switch on the applicant surface (`Mail should go to a different address`) is `.va-switch` (36×20; off track `va:bg-stroke-border`, on `va:bg-primary`) and reveals a second address block; it is not used for yes/no answers. Loan coverages use switches because they are opt-ins with a price. (The library also ships `.va-box-action va-box-action-switch`, a boxed 44px switch row; no frame uses it.) **Evidence:** 348:8076, 449:10462 Switch. **Confidence:** high.
- **Conditional fields reveal in place, indented, with a left rule.** BSA follow-ups ("Do you plan to send or receive international wires?" → "To or from which countries?") and the mailing address block indent ~22px under a vertical hairline (`va:border-l va:border-stroke-divider va:pl-5.5` `[raw]`). Nothing opens a modal or a new step. **Evidence:** BSA_Filled.png, Business_Details_mailing_address.png. **Confidence:** high (composition) / medium (exact indent — §13).
- **Two button tiers.** *Step tier:* the Standard button — `.va-btn` at 48 (`va:h-12`), `va:type-button-label` (`--text-button-label`: Inter Semi Bold 14/20, +10% tracking, bundled UPPERCASE), `va:rounded-sm` (`--radius-sm`: 4px), with an 18px arrow `svg` child — `BACK` = `.va-btn va-btn-secondary` (`va:border va:border-stroke-border`, `--color-stroke-border`: #1a1a1a @17%, ink `va:text-content-secondary`, leading `#arrow-left`), primary = `.va-btn va-btn-primary` (`va:bg-primary`, `--color-primary`: #a6192e; `:disabled` → `va:bg-primary-disabled`, `--color-primary-disabled`: #a6192e @30%; trailing `#arrow-right`); a disabled Back is `.va-btn-secondary:disabled` (`va:border-stroke-divider va:text-content-tertiary` — gray by design, reserved; no current frame disables Back). *Inline tier:* the Utility button — `.va-utility-button va-utility-button-filled` / `va-utility-button-empty` (34 tall, `va:text-field-label` 13/500, natural case — `Add Person`, `Save`, `Cancel`), the same crimson/outline pairing, used only inside a card's inline form. **Evidence:** button instances on all frames; Account_role_2.png, Full_time-1.png. **Confidence:** high.
- **Three add-affordances, chosen by what is being added.** (A) *Review-only entities* that have no step of their own — beneficiary, co-applicant — get a full-width 48px outline button below the cards: `.va-btn va-btn-secondary va:w-full` with a trailing `#plus` (`ADD A BENEFICIARY +`), the heaviest shape because it is the only place the applicant will ever see the option. (B) *Entities that are real steps* — product, owner — get the micro text button, `.va-btn va-btn-micro` + 12px `#plus` (`va:type-micro-label` 9/12, `va:text-content-secondary` → primary on hover — the same component as the OwnerContainer `EDIT`), right-aligned in the section header (`ADD PRODUCT +`), because the action re-enters a step the applicant has already seen. (C) *Rows in a list being edited* — another owner on a roster step — get the same `.va-btn va-btn-micro` + `#plus`, centered in a full-width 48px (`va:h-12`) footer row of the card (`ADD ANOTHER OWNER +`). Emphasis tracks user type and stakes; the three are not interchangeable. **Evidence:** 137:7266, 364:8398, 258:13116; designer decision. **Confidence:** high.
- **Primary is disabled until the step is valid.** Every form, checklist, roster and offer frame shows the primary at 30% (`.va-btn-primary:disabled` → `va:bg-primary-disabled`, white ink kept) until required input exists; only Donate (nothing to enter) and the selected-checklist state show it enabled. **Evidence:** 199:13001 vs 199:12833; 137:7136. **Confidence:** high.
- **Back is a button, not a link, and sits left of the primary — never in the header.** It is present on every step after the first, including choice steps (alone), Review and Agreement. **Evidence:** button rows; designer decisions. **Confidence:** high.
- **Editing happens where the data lives.** Review cards carry `EDIT` (`.va-btn va-btn-micro` + `#pencil`) in the card header; owner rows carry `EDIT` + trash inline (`.va-owner-container-actions`: `.va-btn va-btn-micro` + `.va-icon-button va-icon-button-sm va-icon-button-state` with `#trash-2` and an `aria-label`); owners are added by a form that opens *inside* the roster card, with the list above it still visible. **Evidence:** Business_review.png, Full_time-1.png, Account_role_2.png. **Confidence:** high.
- **Selection is border + tint, not a check color alone.** Selected checklist box: `.va-box-action:has(:checked)` → inset 1px `--color-primary` ring + `va:bg-primary-bg` (#a6192e @6%) + the crimson `.va-checkbox-input:checked` (the label also steps to `va:text-lead`, 16/500); selected segmented tab (Individual/Company): `.va-tab tab-application[aria-selected="true"]` → inset 1px primary ring + `va:bg-primary-bg va:text-primary-text`; selected radio card ("I'll enter their details now"): `.va-select-card:has(.va-radio:checked)` → inset 1px primary + `va:bg-primary-bg`; selected offer card: the same `.va-select-card` selected state (the legacy loan frame's value is not used). **Evidence:** 199:13001 Box; 258:13116 Tabs; Full_time-1.png; 449:10462 Offer Selected=yes. **Confidence:** high.
- **Tables are avoided; the one matrix is a card.** Account Roles is the only column-headed layout on the surface; it is a bordered card with 47px rows of `.va-radio` / `.va-checkbox-control` cells, not a data table with header chrome — no component (§11). **Evidence:** 298:6344. **Confidence:** high.

---

## 6. State handling

- **Empty is the default; there is no separate empty state.** Fields show format placeholders in `va:text-content-hint` (`--color-content-hint`: #8e9195 — the `.va-text-field-input::placeholder` and `.va-dropdown-field-value-placeholder` ink); the checklist shows nothing selected; the roster shows existing owners or the inline form. **Evidence:** 199:12008 vs 199:12185; 290:5694. **Confidence:** high.
- **Progress is quantitative and neutral.** Declared ownership shows `40%` and a 4px bar (`va:h-1 va:rounded-full`) filled `va:bg-content-primary` (#1a1a1a, not brand) on a `#1a1a1a @8%` track `[raw]` — no progress component and no neutral track token (§13). **Evidence:** 258:13116 State; designer decision. **Confidence:** high.
- **Disabled = 30% of the brand fill, white text** — `.va-btn-primary:disabled` = `va:bg-primary-disabled` (`--color-primary-disabled`: #a6192e @30%), ink `va:text-content-contrast` never fades. The disabled *primary* is never gray. A disabled Back is the library's `.va-btn-secondary:disabled` — `va:border-stroke-divider va:text-content-tertiary`, gray by design and reserved for future use; no current frame disables Back. **Evidence:** all disabled primaries #a6192e @30%; designer decision. **Confidence:** high.
- **Selected = crimson border + 6% crimson tint** (`.va-box-action:has(:checked)`: inset 1px `--color-primary` + `va:bg-primary-bg`); **unselected checklist boxes are the library's rest display — `va:bg-surface-paper` (#fffdfb) with the label in `va:text-content-primary` (#1a1a1a) inside a 1px `stroke-divider` ring.** BoxAction has exactly three displays — rest, active (`:has(:checked)`: primary ring + `va:bg-primary-bg`, label `va:text-lead`) and disabled (`:has(:disabled)`: `va:bg-surface-app-page`, `va:text-content-tertiary`, 0.5px ring) — and the checklist uses rest and active only. **Evidence:** 199:13001; designer decision. **Confidence:** high.
- **Roles are pills, ownership is a number.** Business Review shows `Manager` / `Signer` as `.va-badge` (16px full-round `va:bg-neutral-bg` pill, `va:type-eyebrow va:text-content-secondary` — the OwnerContainer's own `tag` slot) beside a `va:text-title-medium` (16/20/500) percentage (`.va-owner-container-percent`); roster rows show the percentage alone. **Evidence:** Business_review.png, Full_time.png. **Confidence:** high.
- **The offer discount is shown as a strikethrough delta, and coverage acceptance flips the card text to crimson.** `6̶%̶ 5.5% APR`, `0.5% APR discount applied` in `va:text-primary-text`, two-dot pager fills per accepted coverage. Pattern only. **Evidence:** Loan_Web_4/5, Loan_Mobile_4/5. **Confidence:** high.
- **Validation errors render below the field in the warning color, with the field itself in its error display.** Both are the library's: `.va-text-field-box:has([aria-invalid="true"])` → `va:border-warning` (`--color-warning`: #b4791c) and the `.va-text-field-hint` under an invalid input → `va:text-warning-text` (`--color-warning-text`: #8b5d16); `.va-dropdown-field-trigger[aria-invalid="true"]` behaves the same. **Amber is the correct error display** — the Warning ramp is the intended binding on this surface; the `--color-error*` ramp stays unused here, permanently (designer 2026-09-16, D4: the unused `Error/*` ramp is not a slip and must not be rebound). **`.va-text-area-input` HAS an error axis as of `@valiify/shortapp-ui@1.2.0`**, mirroring TextField exactly: `[aria-invalid="true"]` → `va:border-warning`, its `.va-text-area-hint` → `va:text-warning-text`, error+hover excluded by name, error+focus keeping the amber border while the crimson ring still fires. `.va-radio-field` also gained one in 1.2.0, and it is **text-only** — `[aria-invalid="true"]` on the `<fieldset>` (which needs an explicit `role="radiogroup"`) turns `.va-radio-field-hint` to `va:text-warning-text` and the radio controls do not change, because the component has no box to paint. Do not invent a control-level cue for it. **Evidence:** designer decision; library bindings. **Confidence:** high (rule) / low (no frame draws the state).
- **Loading and post-`CONFIRM` success states appear in no frame.** The library ships `.va-skeleton` (16 shapes × sm/md/lg, container `role="status" aria-busy="true"`) and `.va-toast va-toast-success` / `.va-toast-simple`; whether either is used here is open (§13). `.va-modal` is the sanctioned overlay for any future confirmation on this surface (reserved).

---

## 7. Navigation and progression

- **Forward is the primary button or a card tap; back is the outline button, on every step after the first.** Choice steps render the row with `BACK` alone (`.va-btn va-btn-secondary`). **Evidence:** §2 table; designer decision. **Confidence:** high.
- **Position is the eyebrow only.** `STEP n OF m / SECTION`. Section names repeat across steps (`BSA DETAILS` on 5 and 6; `BUSINESS DETAILS` on 4 and 9). **Evidence:** eyebrow texts. **Confidence:** high.
- **Review is the hub for edits.** Every review card has `EDIT`; every roster row has `EDIT`; `ADD PRODUCT +` / `ADD OWNER +` (business) or `ADD A BENEFICIARY +` / `ADD A CO-APPLICANT +` (consumer) let the applicant grow the application from Review (affordances B and A respectively, §5). **Evidence:** 364:8398, 137:7266. **Confidence:** high.
- **Two forward verbs only: `CONTINUE` for every intermediate step, `CONFIRM` for Donate, Review (consumer and business) and Agreement.** Both are `.va-btn va-btn-primary` — the verb is content, not a variant. **Evidence:** button texts; designer decisions. **Confidence:** high.
- **`CONFIRM` on the final Review step hands off to the Applicant Portal.** The Short App has no success or submitted screen of its own; the portal (see `applicant-portal.md`) is the landing page after submission. Do not compose a confirmation page on this surface. **Evidence:** designer decision 2026-09-10. **Confidence:** high.
- **Linked legal text is inline and underlined,** never a separate step: `terms of use`, `privacy policy`, `Electronic agreement disclosure`, `fee schedule`, `membership signature card`. Plain `<a>` with `va:underline` inside the disclaimer's `va:text-label` run; the library ships no link component (`va:text-link` is a 14/Auto token with no consumer here). **Evidence:** Disclaimer container texts. **Confidence:** high.
- **Language switch is a header dropdown available on every step** — `.va-text-selector` (`aria-haspopup="listbox"`, `aria-expanded` flips the chevron and darkens the ink) opening a `.va-dropdown-list` of `.va-list-option va-list-option-sm` rows. **Evidence:** Text Selector on every Header. **Confidence:** high.

---

## 8. Copy and tone

- **Titles are questions or plain imperatives in sentence case, no trailing period:** "Are you currently a member?", "Tell us about yourself", "Select a loan offer", "One last step". **Evidence:** title texts. **Confidence:** high.
- **Second person, first-person consent.** Descriptions address "you"; disclaimers are "I have read and understand…", "I consent to…". **Evidence:** Disclaimer container texts. **Confidence:** high.
- **Step buttons are single uppercase verbs:** `BACK`, `CONTINUE`, `CONFIRM` — typed in sentence case; the `va:type-button-label` utility on `.va-btn-primary` / `.va-btn-secondary` supplies the caps (the library's casing-is-a-transform rule). Inline buttons are sentence-case verb + object: `Add Person`, `Save`, `Cancel`, `Add Another Owner` (`.va-utility-button` never transforms). **Evidence:** Button Text nodes. **Confidence:** high.
- **Field labels are the question or a short noun in sentence case; placeholders show the format, not a repeat of the label.** "What is your monthly income?" / `0.00`; "Phone number" / `000-000-0000`; "SSN, last 4" / `••••`. Labels are `.va-text-field-title`, `va:text-label-strong va:text-content-secondary` (`--text-label-strong`: Inter Medium 14/20): `First name`, `Date of birth`, `Business address`. **Evidence:** Label and {text} nodes; designer decision. **Confidence:** high.
- **Help text says what happens next and what won't be needed:** "After you submit, invited owners receive an email and text to complete their own identity details. You won't need their SSN." Always `va:text-help-caption va:text-content-secondary` (`--text-help-caption`: Inter Regular 12/14 · #54565b) behind a left rule, above the button row. Review rows use `va:text-timestamp` (12/16). **Evidence:** Footer "Layer field"; designer decision. **Confidence:** high.
- **Optional is a word, not an asterisk.** `Optional` right-aligned in gray (`va:text-help-caption va:text-content-tertiary`) in the field's title row — `.va-dropdown-field-optional` / `.va-text-area-optional` today; `.va-text-field` gains the same slot (§12). Required fields are unmarked. **Evidence:** Business_Details-1.png; designer decision. **Confidence:** high.
- **Middot separates inline metadata** (`(123) 456-7890 · john.smith@valiify.com` in `.va-owner-container-contact-text`, `6% APR • 60 Months`). **Evidence:** Contact Container; Offer Metrics. **Confidence:** high.

## 9. Anti-patterns

### 9.1 Failure modes this surface avoids (page-level)

| Failure mode | What the frames do instead | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Decision fatigue | One question per choice step; one topic per form step | §2 |
| Hidden progress | Eyebrow on every step; disabled primary until valid | §3, §6 |
| Buried consent | Consent rows are full-width, hairline-separated, with inline links; never a modal | 137:7541 |
| Ambiguous selection | Border + tint + control state together, never color alone | §5 |
| Dead-end edits | Every review card and roster row has an edit path; adds happen from Review | §7 |
| Orphaned conditional fields | Reveals indent under a left rule beneath their trigger | §5 |
| Format guessing | Every shaped field has a format placeholder | §5 |

### 9.2 Things the designer never does here

- Never a sidebar, rail, tab strip, breadcrumb, or KPI band. One column. (`.va-tabs` exists in the library; the only tab on this surface is the Individual/Company `.va-tab va-tab-application` pair inside a form.)
- Never a table with header chrome; the one matrix is a card.
- Never pure white on the applicant surface — surfaces are `va:bg-surface-paper` (#fffdfb) on `va:bg-surface-app-page` (#fafaf9); `--color-content-contrast` (#ffffff) is ink on fills only.
- Never a gray disabled *primary*; the disabled primary is the brand at 30% (`va:bg-primary-disabled`). A disabled Back is the library's gray `.va-btn-secondary:disabled`, reserved for future use.
- No current frame uses an overlay — inline forms, inline reveals. When a confirmation needs one, it is the library's `.va-modal` (reserved); never a bespoke drawer.
- Never a progress bar or back control in the header.
- Never monospace, never colored value text, never severity dots. (`--font-mono` is defined in the theme and has no consumer on this surface.)
- Never a second typeface; Inter only.
- Never `NEXT` as a button label; the forward verbs are `CONTINUE` and `CONFIRM`.
- Never a frame's typo reproduced; copy defects in source frames are accidents.
- Never an asterisk for required.
- Never more than one primary per screen; never a primary in the header.
- Never a value from the legacy loan frames (their text ink, red, white surface, radius 8, light weight) — pattern only.

### 9.3 Dashboard tokens and patterns that must not leak in

The reviewer surface (`dashboard.md`) has its own language. None of it belongs here, and none of it is *in* here: the values below were checked against this library's `src/themes/valiify.css` and resolve to nothing.

- **Deep-blue accent `#1e4d8c` and cool canvas `#f0f3f7`.** Verified absent — this library's `--color-primary` is crimson #a6192e and its canvas is `--color-surface-app-page` #fafaf9 / paper #fffdfb. **Confidence:** high.
- **Blue-black hairlines at `#141428 @8%`.** Verified absent — every applicant hairline is warm-black `--color-stroke-*` on #1a1a1a: card rings 1px `stroke-divider`, header and separators `va:border-stroke-divider` (1px, @11%), control strokes `va:border-stroke-border` (1px, @17%; 1.5px on `.va-checkbox-control` / `.va-radio`). **Confidence:** high.
- **10.5px semi-bold tracked labels, 12.5px data type, 13px row titles.** The applicant floor is `va:type-eyebrow` (11/16) for eyebrows, `va:text-help-caption` (12/14) for help text and `va:text-timestamp` (12/16) for review rows; body is 14–16 (`va:text-label`, `va:text-input`); titles `va:text-display` (28). Nothing under 11 on a page (the library's `va:type-micro-label` 9/12 appears only inside `.va-btn-micro` and `.va-action-status`). **Confidence:** high.
- **JetBrains Mono for IDs, counts, timestamps.** No monospace anywhere on the applicant surface; IDs and phone numbers are Inter. **Confidence:** high.
- **The 140/960 margin-label module grid, summary rail, tab lenses, kebab menus, popover menus, KPI tiles, filter chips, severity dots, verification-column vocabulary (`Verified` / `Applicant stated` / `n/m checks`).** None appear. **Confidence:** high.
- **Reviewer voice** ("Requirement", "Finding", "Source", "Go to source · KYB · TIN check"). Applicant copy is second person and never names vendors or checks. **Confidence:** high.
- **Compact 24–28px controls.** Applicant controls are 48 (`va:h-12`) — `.va-btn`, `.va-text-field-box`, `.va-dropdown-field-trigger`, `.va-box-action-checkbox`. The library's 34px `.va-utility-button` and 24px `.va-icon-button-state` appear only inside cards. **Confidence:** high.

## 10. Component map

Every pattern in §1–§8 that the library ships, with the class to use. Slots and states follow the library's `CLAUDE.md`.

| Pattern | Library |
|---|---|
| Header: 60 bar, centered logo, bottom hairline, language selector; mobile `EN` swap | `.va-header` › `.va-header-logo`, `.va-header-desktop` / `.va-header-mobile` › `.va-text-selector` (`.va-text-selector-icon`, `-label`, `-chevron`); sticky z-40 |
| Language dropdown panel | `.va-dropdown-list` › `.va-list-option va-list-option-sm` (`aria-selected`) |
| Choice card (76, chevron, radius 6) | `.va-select-card` (`<button>`) › `.va-select-card-text` › `.va-select-card-title` (`va:text-label-strong` 14/20), `.va-select-card-description`, `.va-select-card-chevron` (18, `va:text-neutral`) |
| Selected radio card ("I'll enter their details now") | `.va-select-card` (`<label>`) + `.va-radio`; `:has(:checked)` → 1px primary ring + `va:bg-primary-bg` |
| Checklist box (48, checkbox, selected = crimson ring + 6% tint) | `.va-box-action va-box-action-checkbox` › `.va-checkbox-control` › `.va-checkbox-input` + `.va-checkbox-check`, `.va-box-action-label`; rest and active displays only |
| Checkbox (18, radius 3, 1.5px ring) | `.va-checkbox-control` › `.va-checkbox-input` + `.va-checkbox-check` (`#check`) |
| Radio (20) | `.va-radio` on `<input type="radio">` |
| Yes / No radio group | `.va-radio-field` (`<fieldset>`) › `.va-radio-field-title` (`<legend>`), `.va-radio-field-options`, `.va-radio-field-option`, optional `.va-radio-field-hint` |
| Text input with label (73 pitch, 48 box, radius 4, `$` icon) | `.va-text-field` › `.va-text-field-title-row` › `.va-text-field-title`; `.va-text-field-box` › `.va-text-field-icon` + `.va-text-field-input`; `.va-text-field-hint`; `Optional` title-row slot planned (§12) |
| Multi-line free text with label (104 pitch, 79 box, radius 4) — an answer that is a list or a sentence | `.va-text-area` › `.va-text-area-title-row` › `.va-text-area-title` (+ optional `-optional`, `-help`); `.va-text-area-input` (the native `<textarea>` IS the box); `.va-text-area-hint`.

The multi-line free-text field was on that list until 2026-09-16 and is now mapped in the table above — see §13.1. **Keep this note on its own line, and do not write the class name in backticks here:** the class-audit harvests every backticked class from the shipped-but-unused sentence's line and treats it as forbidden, so a removal note sharing that line silently re-adds what it says was removed.

## 11. Patterns with no component

Compose these from tokens and the primitives above. Nothing in `_dashboard-archive/` may be cited or imported; `_template.css` is scaffolding, not a component.

| Pattern | Composition |
|---|---|
| Page shell | canvas `va:bg-surface-app-page`; body `va:w-140 va:mx-auto va:py-12 va:flex va:flex-col va:gap-10`; `.va-header` as a direct child of the scroll container (sticky contract) |
| Title block | `va:type-eyebrow` row (`va:text-content-tertiary` run + `va:text-primary-text` section) › `va:text-display va:text-content-primary` › `va:text-input va:text-content-secondary`, `va:gap-2` |
| Button row (web) | `va:flex va:gap-6`; `.va-btn va-btn-secondary` (+ `#arrow-left`) · `.va-btn va-btn-primary va:flex-1` (+ `#arrow-right`); `va:w-full` primary when no Back; in flow |
| Mobile footer (interim, until the §12 component lands) | `va:h-19 va:py-3.5 va:px-4 va:flex va:gap-5 va:bg-surface-paper va:border-t va:border-stroke-divider va:mt-auto va:sticky va:bottom-0 va:z-40`; `.va-btn va-btn-secondary` 99 + `.va-btn va-btn-primary va:flex-1`; the bar's horizontal padding follows the shell's (`va:px-5` on the revised BSA frames — 720:8131 pads 14/20; 721:8460 still 14/16, a frame inconsistency on the designer list). **Pinning contract:** the footer is a DIRECT child of the scroll container (`<body>`), which is `va:min-h-screen va:flex va:flex-col`; `va:mt-auto` parks the bar at the viewport bottom when the step is shorter than the screen, `va:sticky va:bottom-0` keeps it there while a taller step scrolls. A wrapper around the bar becomes its containing block and makes the sticky inert (§13.1, 2026-09-17) |
| Sub-section label + hairline | `va:type-eyebrow va:text-content-secondary` over `va:border-b va:border-stroke-divider` |

| Product review card | card as above, `va:p-4 va:flex va:items-center va:justify-between va:gap-4`; left `va:text-label-strong` product name over `va:text-label va:text-content-secondary` one-line description; right `View Details` as a plain `<a>` `va:text-label va:text-content-secondary va:underline` (no button component); group label carries affordance (B) `ADD PRODUCT +` |
| Affordance (A) | `.va-btn va-btn-secondary va:w-full` + `#plus` below the review cards |
| Affordance (B) | `.va-btn va-btn-micro` + `#plus`, `va:ml-auto` in the group label row |
| Affordance (C) | `va:h-12 va:w-full va:flex va:items-center va:justify-center` row holding `.va-btn va-btn-micro` + `#plus`, last row of the roster card |
| Roster card | `va:bg-surface-paper va:rounded-sm va:ring-1 va:ring-inset va:ring-stroke-divider`; `.va-owner-container` rows (own bottom hairline); inline form `va:bg-surface-app-page va:p-5 va:flex va:flex-col va:gap-4`, fields `va:w-[518px]`, two-up `va:flex va:gap-4`; footer affordance (C) |
| Ownership progress | label row `va:h-9.5 va:flex va:items-center va:justify-between va:text-label-strong`; track `va:h-1 va:rounded-full` in `#1a1a1a @8%` `[raw]` with fill `va:bg-content-primary` |
| Roles matrix | card as above; header `va:h-6 va:grid` `va:w-79 / va:w-30 / va:w-30` in `va:type-eyebrow va:text-content-secondary`; rows `va:h-[47px] va:py-1 va:px-4 va:grid` with `box-shadow: inset 0 -1px 0 var(--color-stroke-divider)`; cells `.va-radio` / `.va-checkbox-control`; `.va-tabs` › `.va-tab va-tab-application` for Individual/Company |
| Informational confirm card | `va:bg-surface-paper va:rounded-sm va:p-4 va:ring-1 va:ring-inset va:ring-stroke-divider`; `va:text-label-strong` title, `va:text-label va:text-content-secondary` body |
| Two-up fields | column level `va:flex va:flex-col va:gap-5` → `va:md:flex-row va:md:gap-6`, `va:md:w-67` each (mobile-first — see §11) / `va:flex va:gap-4` (inside the 518 inline form) |
| Three-up standalone fields (Phone / ZIP / SSN last 4) | `va:flex va:gap-4`; first field `va:flex-1`, the two short fields `va:w-32` (128) each (272 + 16 + 128 + 16 + 128 = 560); stacks on mobile per §1.2. Standalone titled fields only — the address composite below is a different pattern |
| Address composite (Address / Apt / City · State · ZIP) | one joined group, not three fields: outer `va:rounded-sm` container with `va:ring-1 va:ring-inset va:ring-stroke-divider`; rows Address, Apt, City·State·ZIP stacked with `va:border-b va:border-stroke-divider` seams, no gaps; inputs are `.va-text-field-box` without `.va-text-field-title-row` (the composite has no per-field titles — the group's title is `Address` above it); the last row is `va:grid va:grid-cols-[7fr_4fr_5fr]` with `va:border-l va:border-stroke-divider` seams between cells (City ≈ 44% / State ≈ 25% / ZIP ≈ 31%); State is a `.va-dropdown-field-trigger`; `Optional` on the Apt row sits inside the input, right-aligned, `va:text-help-caption va:text-content-tertiary` (the only place Optional is not in a title row). Same proportions at 343; State label → `ST`, ZIP placeholder → `ZIP`. Evidence 676:4758 / 676:4982, measured from PNG — confidence medium on the exact ratio |
| Open listbox panel (`.va-dropdown-field` trigger, header language selector) | trigger wrapped in `va:relative`; the `.va-dropdown-list` panel `va:absolute va:top-full va:mt-1 va:z-60` — plus `va:left-0 va:w-full` to span a field trigger, or `va:right-0 va:w-32` for the header language menu; mounted only while open. The 4px offset is a library decision: no frame draws an open panel (Dropdown Field set 1:358 has no open variant) — see §13.1, 2026-09-17 |
| Switch row (mailing-address toggle, coverage opt-ins) | `va:flex va:items-center va:justify-between va:gap-4 va:h-12`; label `va:text-label-strong va:text-content-secondary` left, `.va-switch` right; the revealed block follows as a conditional reveal |
| `Optional` on a text field (interim, until the §12 slot ships) | `.va-text-field-title-row va:flex va:justify-between` with a trailing `<span class="va:ml-auto va:text-help-caption va:text-content-tertiary">Optional</span>`, mirroring `.va-dropdown-field-optional` |
| Offer selection (loan, pattern only) | total card + collapsible breakdown as a review-style card; coverage rows as `va:flex` rows with `.va-switch`; offers as `.va-select-card` (`<label>` + `.va-radio`); strikethrough `va:line-through va:text-content-tertiary` + `va:text-primary-text` delta |

## 12. Planned library additions

Decided; repo work outside this document (Figma component first, then the library's `/extract` → `npm run new:component` → visual-spec process). Until they ship, pages use the interim recipes in §11; once they ship, the rows here become §10 entries.

A class named in this section does **not** exist yet, so it is written **without a leading
dot** — `va-text-field-optional`. The dotted form asserts a class the bundle ships, and
`npm run verify:vocabulary` reads it exactly that way; a planned name is a name, not a
reference. Add the dot in the same change that adds the class.

| Addition | Spec from the frames | Library home |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile sticky action bar | 76 tall (`va:h-19`), `va:py-3.5 va:px-4`, `va:bg-surface-paper`, top hairline `va:border-t va:border-stroke-divider`, `va:sticky va:bottom-0`, `va:z-40`; slots for `.va-btn va-btn-secondary` (99, hug) + `va:gap-5` + `.va-btn va-btn-primary va:flex-1`; applies to every flow below `md` (§1.2) | new component — name to be chosen at scaffold time |
| TextField optional slot | title-row marker `Optional`, `va:ml-auto va:text-help-caption va:text-content-tertiary`, mirroring `.va-dropdown-field-optional` / `.va-text-area-optional` | modifier on `.va-text-field-title-row` — will ship as `va-text-field-optional` (unshipped, so named without a leading dot), the spelling its shipped siblings `.va-dropdown-field-optional` / `.va-text-area-optional` already fix |

## 13. Open items

Anything a page needs from this list is unspecified; do not infer it.

- **Loading state** — none drawn. `.va-skeleton` shapes exist; composition unconfirmed.
- **Web button-row scroll behavior** — in flow by decision; the frames are static and neither confirm nor contradict it.
- **Conditional-reveal indent** — ~22px from PNG only; exact values are in the `Layer field` / `Address Super entry` components. The §11 recipe (`va:pl-5.5`) is the interim rule and is not a stop.
- **Progress-bar track colour** — `#1a1a1a @8%` has no token (`--color-action-active` / `-pressed` share the value but are interaction overlays; `--color-primary-track` is crimson). Raw composition stands until a token or component exists.
- **Roles-matrix label type** — the frame's 16/20 has no component; unmapped.
- **Mobile shell horizontal padding** — the revised BSA mobile frames (2026-09-17) pad 20 (`va:px-5`, 335 column) where every other mobile frame and §1.2's rule say 16 (`va:p-4`, 343). Within the BSA pair, mobile-filled's footer (721:8460) still pads 16. Designer to confirm whether 20 is the shell rule surface-wide; until then a page follows its own frames.
- **`.va-owner-container` pinned height on mobile** — the library pins `va:h-[92.5px]`, but at 343 the contact line wraps and the row must hug (§1.2). Needs a library check: drop the pin below `md` or let the row hug everywhere.
- **Library follow-ups (§12)** — decided but not yet built.

### 13.1 Amendment log

Changes to this file after its initial authoring, with what triggered them. A rule
here was wrong or absent; the entry says how that was established, so the same
question is not re-litigated from the frames each time.

**2026-09-17 — BSA mobile frames revised to 20px horizontal padding; recorded per-frame, rule left open.**

*Triggered by:* Val run `2026-09-16-val-bsa-account-information`, requester note during review:
the designer increased the left/right padding on all elements of 720:8067 and 721:8438 to
20. Re-extraction confirmed: shell padding 16 → 20 on both, column 343 → 335, every field,
divider and label x 16 → 20; the empty frame's footer bar pads 14/20 (primary 224 → 216),
the filled frame's footer bar still 14/16 (not updated); heights unchanged; header unchanged
(already 20). §1.2 records the revised frames' values with `va:px-5`; because the rule "same
343 column / 16 padding" rests on other flows' frames, the surface-wide question is a §13
open item rather than a silent rewrite.

**2026-09-17 — the mobile footer's pinning is spelled out; "sticky" alone never engaged.**

*Triggered by:* Val run `2026-09-16-val-bsa-account-information`, requester review of the
375 render: the footer bar sat in flow under the last field with empty canvas beneath it.
§1.2 said "sticky footer" and the §11 recipe carried `va:sticky va:bottom-0`, but the
surface had no `va:min-h-screen` / `va:mt-auto`, and the page had wrapped the bar in a
mount div — a containing block exactly the bar's height, inside which `va:sticky` can do
nothing. On a step shorter than the viewport, `va:sticky va:bottom-0` alone never pins anyway:
it needs the scroll container to be at least viewport-tall and the bar pushed to its end.
The recipe now states the contract: `<body>` (the scroll container) is `va:min-h-screen
va:flex va:flex-col`; the bar is its direct child with `va:mt-auto va:sticky va:bottom-0
va:z-40`. Both mobile frames pin the bar to the artboard bottom (720:8067 → 991–1067,
721:8438 → 1464–1540), so this is frame evidence, not a library decision.

**2026-09-17 — the open listbox panel has a recipe; it was absent, not forbidden.**

*Triggered by:* Val run `2026-09-16-val-bsa-account-information` (BSA Details, step 5 of
10, built in the strict 1.3.0 vocabulary). The requester saw the `.va-dropdown-list`
panel push the fields below it down and sit flush against its trigger. Cause: §11 named
the panel's classes (`.va-dropdown-list` › `.va-list-option`) but no positioning, and the
generated utility surface therefore carried no `va:absolute` / `va:relative` / `va:top-*` /
`va:left-*` / `va:right-*` / `va:mt-*` — a page that may write only sanctioned classes could only
render the panel in flow.

*Why the methodology was what was wrong:* the library's DropdownField and TextSelector
docs say "consumer JS positions and toggles" the panel — positioning is a surface
concern by contract, and the surface never said how. No frame in the file draws an open
panel (Dropdown Field set 1:358 has no open variant; the language menu is never shown
open), so the recipe is a library decision, recorded as such: panel `va:absolute
va:top-full va:mt-1 va:z-60` (the z-scale's modal/panel step) inside a `va:relative`
wrapper on the trigger; `va:left-0 va:w-full` spans a field, `va:right-0 va:w-32` sits
a header menu under its selector. The 4px `va:mt-1` offset has no frame evidence and is
open to the designer.

**2026-09-16 — `.va-text-area` is mapped; it was never unsanctioned, only unenumerated.**

*Triggered by:* design run `2026-09-16-design-bsa-account-information` (BSA Details,
step 5 of 10). The concept architect returned `CONCEPT: BLOCKED | no-component` on the
three "To or from which countries?" fields: §2, §5 and §10 named no multi-line control,
and §10's closing line listed `.va-text-area` among components "no in-scope frame uses",
followed by "Do not map by analogy" — a prohibition. The architect correctly refused to
compose it and refused to silently downgrade to a single-line field.

*Why the methodology was what was wrong:* the library had just shipped an error axis on
`.va-text-area` **for these exact fields** (`@valiify/shortapp-ui@1.2.0`, decisions
D1/D3), so the file asserted a component was unused on this surface in the same week the
library extended it to serve that surface.

*How it was established, before editing:* the BSA Filled frame (`199:12185`) was read
directly. It contains **two** `Text Area Field` instances — `636:2045` at y=606 (the wire
countries field, C3) and `636:2448` at y=1025 (the international-customer countries field,
C6) — each 560×104, which is the component's own 25 label row over its 79 box. Both are
multi-line controls, drawn, in an in-scope frame. Note their node ids (`636:*`) against
the frame's own (`199:*`): they were added to the frame **after** it was authored, which
is consistent with BSA not having been among the screens enumerated when §10's
shipped-but-unused line was written. The line was stale, not a decision.

*Evidence precision — one correction to the question as asked:* the request named
"BSA C3/C5/C6" as the frame evidence. Only **C3 and C6** are drawn. **C5** — the ACH
countries field — appears nowhere in the filled frame, because that frame's ACH
international-wires child is not answered `Yes`. C5's existence rests on the brief's
explicit statement that the wire and ACH chains behave identically, not on a drawn
control. Two drawn instances are sufficient evidence for this amendment; C5 is composed
by that stated symmetry.

*Edits made:* §5 (free entry split by single-line vs multi-line), §6 (the "no error axis"
claim corrected, and RadioField's text-only error axis recorded), §10 (new multi-line row
with frame evidence; `.va-text-area` removed from the shipped-but-unused line).
`.claude/skills/valiify-shortapp-ui/SKILL.md` was corrected in the same change for the
same reason.

*Unchanged by this amendment:* decisions D1–D4 stand exactly as taken. The error axis was
the right call; this is the methodology catching up to it.
